Learning and documenting how to use AWS

There is two ways to complete most if not all the actions here. The first time I go through my learning, I will be doing it through the console. I eventually plan to go back through all the steps and to automate everything using the CLI option. I haven't decided if I want to do this after each step or at the end of everything.

## Account Basics

#### IAM Users

Creating IAM users are important as it allows you to have multiple users using your AWS account without giving your own account details. Additionally, creating an IAM user for yourself is best practice as this adds a bit more security so that if the root account gets comprimised, you won't "lose" much.

1) Sign into the AWS Console and go to the IAM Console.
2) Choose Users -> Add User.
3) File in a name for the account. You can create multiple users at this stage.
4) Select AWS Management Console as the access type. Also, select Autogenerated password for the password type.
5) At this point, you can add a user to a group, copy permissions from another user or attach an existing policy to the user. I decided to add the user to an Administrator group.
6) You are able to review changes at this stage and verify if everything is correct. If it is then you can send the user, via email, their log in credentials.

The new user is now setup and ready to be used.

#### Root User Management

The next step is securing the root user for AWS. The method I will be using is a virtual type of authentication with Google Authenticator. While hardware type authentication is more secure, I did not have access to any FOB. If access to an authenticator is lost, the AWS support team can be contacted for further steps.

1) Sign into the AWS Console, choose Dashboard -> Security Status -> Activate MFA on your root user.
2) Select Activate MFA and then continue.
3) Select Virtual MFA Device and then continue. At this point the you should have a virtual MFA app installed on your phone.
4) The easiest way to setup MFA on your phone is to scan the QR Code on screen with your phone. You will need to enter 2 separate MFA codes.
5) Select Assign MFA and then Finish.

MFA is now setup on the root user for AWS. The same thing can be done with a regular IAM user.

##### Note: For the next sub-section, I won't be providing steps as it's more simple to just look it up in the AWS user guide. I will add this note whenever I'm going to skip the steps portion.

#### Billing Alerts

Setting up billing alerts is really important as you do not want to go over your budget or exceed costs in general. Having an alert will notify you of approaching usage limits, I've gotten plenty of these just learning all this, as well as potential costs. I won't be going over the procedures as this is almost a one time thing when you have everything set up. Under the Billing and Cost Management Console, you are able to check, create and delete billing alerts from here.

#### AWS CLI Setup

While I did mention that I will try to automate everything with the CLI at a later date, I might as well setup the this portion now and have it ready to go on my computer. The CLI provides direct access to the AWS public API which allows for exploring of service capabilities and develop scripts to manage resources. There is more to the CLI than this, but this is all I'm concerned about.

In order to get started, I downloaded the MSI installer directly and simply ran the installation.
