Learning and documenting how to use AWS

## Account Basics

#### IAM Users

Creating IAM users are important as it allows you to have multiple users using your AWS account without giving your own account details. Additionally, creating an IAM user for yourself is best practice as this adds a bit more security so that if the root account gets comprimised, you won't "lose" much.

The 2 main ways of creating an IAM user is to either use the console (web browser) or to use the CLI through some sort of OS. I decided to cover the creation of the user through the console.

*NOTE: The CLI portion of this will be completed when I go back through this document and automate everything.*

1) Sign into the AWS Console and go to the IAM Console.
2) Choose Users -> Add User.
3) File in a name for the account. You can create multiple users at this stage.
4) Select AWS Management Console as the access type. Also, select Autogenerated password for the password type.
5) At this point, you can add a user to a group, copy permissions from another user or attach an existing policy to the user. I decided to add the user to an Administrator group.
6) You are able to review changes at this stage and verify if everything is correct. If it is then you can send the user, via email, their log in credentials.

The new user is now setup and ready to be used.

#### Root User Management

The next step is securing the root user for AWS. The method I will be using is a virtual type of authentication with Google Authenticator. While hardware type authentication is more secure, I did not have access to any FOB. If access to an authenticator is lost, the AWS support team can be contacted for further steps.

1) Sign into the AWS Console, choose Dashboard -> Security Status -> Activate MFA on your root user.
2)
